He still thinks he’s right, a new documentary finds.</h2>

<p>It has been more than a decade since James D. Watson, a founder of modern genetics, landed in a kind of professional exile by suggesting that black people are intrinsically less intelligent than whites.</p>

<p>In 2007, Dr. Watson, who shared a 1962 Nobel Prize for describing the double-helix structure of DNA, told a British <span class="ths-marker" data-tag="mod"></span> journalist that <span class="ths-marker" data-tag="off" data-limit="1s" data-spread="1,50%"> he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says, not really.”</p>

var parentTag = document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1].parentNode;
parentTag.classList.add("ths-gutter");

 parentTag.setAttribute('data-tags', 'mod,off'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-debug', 'false'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-placement', 'right'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-width', '6.5'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-color', 'black,red'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-margin', '0'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-resolution', '1'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-gap', '1'); 


 parentTag.setAttribute('data-padding', '3'); 
 parentTag.setAttribute('data-merge', 'false'); 

</script>


<p>Moreover, he added, although he wished everyone were equal, “people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.”</p>

<p>Dr. Watson’s comments reverberated around the world, and he was forced to retire from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, although he retains an office there.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>And yet, offered the chance recently to recast a tarnished legacy, Dr. Watson has chosen to reaffirm it, this time on camera. In a new documentary, “American Masters: Decoding Watson,&rdquo; to be broadcast on PBS on Wednesday night, he is asked whether his views about the relationship between race and intelligence have changed.</p>

<p>“No,’’ Dr. Watson said. “Not at all. I would like for them to have changed, that there be new knowledge that says that your nurture is much more important than nature. But I haven’t seen any knowledge. And there’s a difference <span class="ths-marker" data-tag="off"> on the average between blacks and whites on I.Q. tests. I would say the difference is, it’s genetic.’’</p>

<p>Dr. Watson adds that he takes no pleasure in “the difference between blacks and whites” and wishes it didn’t exist. “It’s awful, just like it’s <span class="ths-marker" data-tag="mod" data-limit="2s" data-spread="1,75%"> awful for schizophrenics,” he says. (His son Rufus was diagnosed in his teens with schizophrenia.) Dr. Watson continues: “If the difference exists, we have to ask ourselves, how can we try and make it better?”</p>

<p>Dr. Watson’s remarks may well ignite another firestorm of criticism. At the very least, they will pose a challenge for historians when they take the measure of the man: How should such fundamentally unsound views be weighed against his extraordinary scientific contributions?</p>

<p>In response to questions from The Times, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that most experts on intelligence “consider any black-white differences in I.Q. testing to arise primarily from environmental, not genetic, differences.”</p>

<p>This article is an excerpt from the New York Times. It highlights how the gutter would work to enhance the reader&rsquo;s experience. I make no attempt to judge the merits of the author&rsquo;s opinion or the subject&rsquo;s opinion. I make no attempt to judge the <em>quality</em> of journalism.</p>

<p>If you resize the browser window, you will see it adapt. You can see that the black strip warns the reader to brace themselves for something that is potentially offensive. The red strip advises the reader of segments that potentially place enormous pressure on their &ldquo;mass-model.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For subject matter that is potentially controversial, I contend that journalists have a duty to warn readers beforehand so that they can interpret the article <a href="https://thehonestscoop.com/why/gutter/">more fairly.</a></p>
