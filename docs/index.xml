      <description>Installation The Gutter is available on npm but the recommended usage is via unpkg unless you have advanced javascript knowledge and you know how to use a bundler.
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/@thehonestscoop/gutter@latest&amp;#34; defer&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; Make sure you insert it below the closing &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; tag because it is imperative that the script runs after the rest of your page is loaded. Be wary that not all legacy browsers recognize the defer statement.</description>

      <title>The Gutter</title>

      <description>The Gutter Usage A gutter is denoted by using a div tag with a class of ths-gutter. Multiple gutters can co-exist on the same page as long as there is no ancestral relationship (eg. parent-child).
Each gutter will operate independently to each other.
A gutter contains at least 1 strip but may contain more.
You must prefix each parameter below with data- in the HTML.
tags (required) A tag is used to create a strip.</description>

      <title>Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://thehonestscoop.com/docs/lemma-chain/use-cases/</link>

      <guid>https://thehonestscoop.com/docs/lemma-chain/use-cases/</guid>
      <description>Some Use Cases Academic Citations Most, if not all, academic articles reference other articles and books as citations. Lemma-Chain can be used to encode the &amp;ldquo;chain of citations.&amp;rdquo; Furthermore, citations can be marked as &amp;lsquo;required&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;suggested&amp;rsquo; reading.
Legal Precedents In common-law legal systems, Courts are expected to follow the precedents set by prior decisions. These precedents can be categorized as either &amp;lsquo;binding&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;persuasive.&amp;rsquo; Lemma-Chain can be used to encode the cited cases in court judgments.</description>

      <guid>https://thehonestscoop.com/docs/lemma-chain/account/</guid>
      <description>Accounts A reference can be owned by a registered account or unowned. The advantage of creating a registered account is that all references created under the account can be listed together.
Each account must have a unique name when lower-cased. Once created, the name will be prepended with a @. Each account must also be registered with a unique non-disposable email address.
Upon account creation, you will need to verify the account by clicking an email link.</description>

tag (required) The tag denotes to which strip in the gutter the marker belongs to.

      <description>Hugo shortcodes What is Hugo? Hugo is a leading static site generator which allows you to generate websites with minimal coding expertise. It is extremely popular for creating high-quality blogs and documentation.
The Gutter can be easily integrated to Hugo sites, but it does require you to make some minor coding adjustments.
Usage HTML Template  Add the Gutter library to the bottom of the HTML template Make sure it is somewhere below the closing &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; tag.</description>

Create POST https://lemma-chain.thehonestscoop.com/ref
owner (optional) The owner parameter sets the account name of the prospective reference. If unset, the reference will be &amp;lsquo;unowned&amp;rsquo; by an account. If set, the account owner must be currently authenticated.

      <description>Frequently Asked Questions How can I diagnose potential issues? You can enable debug mode for the gutter. This will clearly showcase the results of the sentence detection algorithm as well as print out various diagnostic details in the browser console. See more info here.
Can I implement other shading equations other than a standard Bell Curve? At this stage, only a standard Bell Curve is implemented. If there is sufficient demand in the future, it will definitely be possible.</description>

      <description>You Don&amp;rsquo;t Appreciate What You Got Until It&amp;rsquo;s Gone A free press has long been considered a critical pillar of a well-functioning democracy. With recent events worldwide, it has become more apparent to many that quality journalism is a luxury that cannot be taken for granted. There is no denying that over the recent generations, there has been a gradual degradation of its perceived importance to society.
As society&amp;rsquo;s value for the institution shrinks either progressively or dramatically, it becomes increasingly more vulnerable to powerful players with opposing interests battering it beyond repair.</description>

      <description>The futuristic film The Minority Report features Tom Cruise as the head of the PreCrime division. The division has the technology to determine ahead of time whether someone is about to commit a crime. The division&amp;rsquo;s patrolmen assemble at the location when the crime is expected to occur to arrest the &amp;ldquo;perpetrator.&amp;rdquo; Tom Cruise&amp;rsquo;s character (and the general population) have full faith in the system. His beliefs reach an impasse when the technology predicts that he will &amp;mdash; within 36 hours &amp;mdash; murder a man named Leo Crow, whom he does not know.</description>

      <description>The Nobel-winning biologist has drawn global criticism with unfounded pronouncements on genetics, race and intelligence. He still thinks he’s right, a new documentary finds. It has been more than a decade since James D. Watson, a founder of modern genetics, landed in a kind of professional exile by suggesting that black people are intrinsically less intelligent than whites.
In 2007, Dr. Watson, who shared a 1962 Nobel Prize for describing the double-helix structure of DNA, told a British  journalist that he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says, not really.</description>

      <description>The ultimate aim of The Honest Scoop is to improve the quality of journalism to the theoretical limit. The project is currently in its infancy. I am still exploring its future direction.
We are looking for software developers and journalists to contribute to the project. The project will be heavily focused on using technology to improve the standard of journalism in an objective way.
