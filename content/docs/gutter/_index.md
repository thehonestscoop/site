## **Overview**

The Gutter provides sentence-aware markers for journalists, academics and bloggers. It can be placed to the left or right of your text and can mark a single sentence, or a range of sentences centered about a particular key sentence.

It uses an advanced sentence-detection algorithm to place your markers in the correct position even after the user resizes their browser.
