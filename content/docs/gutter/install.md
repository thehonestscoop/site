# **Installation**

The Gutter is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thehonestscoop/gutter) but the recommended usage is _via_ [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) unless you have advanced javascript knowledge and you know how to use a bundler.

```html

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@thehonestscoop/gutter@latest" defer></script>

```

Make sure you insert it below the closing `</body>` tag because it is imperative that the script runs _after_ the rest of your page is loaded. Be wary that not all legacy browsers recognize the `defer` statement.
