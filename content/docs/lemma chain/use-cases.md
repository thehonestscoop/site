# **Some Use Cases**


## **Academic Citations**

Most, if not all, academic articles reference other articles and books as citations.
Lemma-Chain can be used to encode the &ldquo;chain of citations.&rdquo; Furthermore, citations can be marked as &lsquo;required&rsquo; or &lsquo;suggested&rsquo; reading.


## **Legal Precedents**

In common-law legal systems, Courts are expected to follow the precedents set by prior decisions. These precedents can be categorized as either &lsquo;binding&rsquo; or &lsquo;persuasive.&rsquo; Lemma-Chain can be used to encode the cited cases in court judgments.

## **Dependency Management**

Most software is made using the code bases of other software libraries. These software libraries are also made using the code bases of other software libraries.

Lemma-Chain can be used to encode the relationships, and also record as a `ref type` whether the dependency is &lsquo;strictly-required&rsquo; or &lsquo;required for development only.&rsquo;
