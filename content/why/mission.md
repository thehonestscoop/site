The ultimate aim of The Honest Scoop is to improve the quality of journalism to the theoretical limit. 
The project is currently in its infancy. I am still exploring its future direction.

We are looking for software developers and journalists to contribute to the project. The project will be heavily focused on using technology to improve the standard of journalism in an objective way.

### Medium Term

* Operate as a news aggregator.
* Become familiar with the reader's primary priority: Local News <&mdash;> Country <&mdash;> World/Humanity, or alternatively the Environment.
* Force feed articles to the reader rather than allows them to choose. That way, the reader can be exposed to a broader array of opinions and analysis.

### Long Term

* Formally register as a not-for-profit organization that will be beholden to no one &mdash; and everyone.
* Accept donations for survival.
* Develop advanced machine-learning algorithms to analyze articles for unjustified biases.
